### 🔍 Why Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors?

We chose two popular classification algorithms :

#### ✅ Logistic Regression
- **Simple and interpretable** model.
- Works well when classes are linearly separable.
- Provides probability estimates, useful for understanding model confidence.
- Fast training even on large datasets.

#### ✅ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Instance-based learning**: Makes predictions based on closest training samples.
- Effective when decision boundaries are non-linear.
- No training phase — lazy learner, making it intuitive and easy to implement.
- Highly accurate on well-structured datasets like Iris.

These models help us explore both **linear** (Logistic Regression) and **non-linear** (KNN) decision boundaries — giving a well-rounded understanding of classification techniques.
